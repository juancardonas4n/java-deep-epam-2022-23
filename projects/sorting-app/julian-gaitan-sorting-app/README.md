# Sorting App Project

Solution of the practice exercise Sorting App Project for the Introduction to Maven and JUnit module.

### Note:

To do the unitary test I use java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream and java.io.PrintStream to read the output of the application, I hope this is okay.
Also, the application will ignore any input element beyond the 10th
