# Sorting App

The Sorting App Project is a mandatory task for the "Deep dive into Java development" course of Epam.

## Description

The task helps you to get a practical grasp of Apache Maven and its major features. 
I created a Maven-based project â€“ Sorting App. It is a small Java application that takes up to ten command-line arguments as integer values, sorts them in the ascending order, and then prints them into standard output.
